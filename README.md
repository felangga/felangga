## About Me
Hello welcome to my page, I'm a software engineer that also has interest in hardware development, especially in Radio Frequency (RF) and Microcontroller. Currently I'm an amateur HAM radio operator callsign [YD2UFV](https://www.qrz.com/db/YD2UFV), but not really active in the air, only interested in learning and experimenting. 

I'm also a big fan of Vintage Electronics and I'm also doing some restoration projects for some old radios and old computers especially Apple Computers (Apple II and Macintosh), you can visit my [TikTok page](https://www.tiktok.com/@erlandelectro).
